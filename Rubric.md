## Front-End Design
__YES__ 2 pts: Game has a robust, understandable text-based interface that allows the player to control their movement through the game. Player should be able to enter any command at any time, and if it makes sense in the current context it will be carried out.
    - in this case the only user interface is the name input which I think is clear

N/A cheatsheet needed

N/A Story

___YES___ 2 pts: Game has multiple possible paths / outcomes (i.e. gameplay depends on player's choices and is not the same every time).
    - storyline replaced with changing character generation 

N/A Paths and Reversable Moves
